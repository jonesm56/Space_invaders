# Space Invaders
We decided to create the known game Space Invaders on a monitor connected to an FPGA Board using Verilog. We used the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Quartus to implement our project. The general rules of the game are there is a spaceship that the player controls using different keys on the board and there are 18 aliens that are shooting at the player. The player wins if it destroys all of the aliens and the player loses if it cannot shoot all of the aliens by the time the aliens move down toward the player and hit the ground. The general Space Invaders Game has a lot of ways the aliens move, for this game the aliens will move right until they hit the edge of the screen and then they will move down and start moving to the left.
